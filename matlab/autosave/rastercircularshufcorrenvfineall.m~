%   FILE NAME       : RASTER CIRCULAR SHUF CORR ENV FINE ALL
%   DESCRIPTION     : Shuffled rastergram circular correlation function.
%                     Computes the envelope shuffled correlation as well as
%                     the fine structure shuffled correlation.
%
%                     Shuffles are performed in two ways:
%
%                     1) First we shuffled between consecutive periods in 
%                     time and perform the correlation between the k-th and
%                     l-th raster (corresoponding to the k-th and l-th 
%                     period). Note that for this procdure, consecutive
%                     cycles have identical envelopes but the fine
%                     structure is uncorrelated. Thus this procedure gives
%                     the envelope shuffled correlogram.
%
%                     2) Second, we shuffle across trail for each cycle
%                     raster. In this case, both the envelope and fine
%                     structure are fixed. This shuffled correlogram
%                     contains buth the fine structure and envelope
%                     correlations.
%
%                     The standard error is obtaine with a Jackknife on the
%                     original data samples.
%
%	RASTER          : Cycle Rastergram (compressed spet format). Generated
%                     using RASTER2CYCLERASTERORDERED. RASTER contains LxM
%                     elements where L corresponds to the number of trials
%                     and M corresponds to the number of cycles over time.
%   Fsd             : sampling rate of raster to compute raster-corr.
%   Delay           : Rearranges the shuffled correlation so that the
%                     zeroth bin is centered about the center of the
%                     correaltion function (at the floor(N/2)+1 sample).
%                     Otherwize, the zeroth bin of the correaltion function
%                     is located at the first sample of Rshuf. (OPTIONAL,
%                     Default == 'n')
