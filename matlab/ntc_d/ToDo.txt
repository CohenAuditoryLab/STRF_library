done:
-----
x  smaller dots in dot-histograms
x  ask for CF before allowing latency and rate measurements

to do:
------
improve measure function on dots (nearest point?  or at least give
    both frequency and amplitude info)
rate doesn't update right unless CF is set
option to bin in latency window?
box for measurement of spontaneous rate

---------

peter heil type stuff at cf
multipeaked options?
confidence flags/scale
automatic boundary choosing for tc
uses tc boundary for range in latency, etc
