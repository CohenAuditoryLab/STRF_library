Graphical interface to analyze (well, "measure" really) tuning curve data
 
General information:
--------------------
 
output file formats:
 -------------------
N.B.: THE 'APPEND' BUTTON MUST BE CLICKED AT LEAST ONCE BEFORE ANY DATA 
      WILL BE PLACED IN THE OUTPUT ARRAY.
 
Output can be in MatLab (.mat) format or either of two types of ASCII text 
  (.txt or .xls), selectable by the user at save time:
 -- A .mat output file will contain a 1x1 cell array of user 'comments';  
   an Ax1 cell array of 'column_labels', where A = the number of attributes 
   in the output array (defined in INCLUDE_DEFS); and an NxA array of 'data', 
   where N = the number of times that attributes were appended to the output;
   ideally, this should equal the number of measured data files.
 -- A .txt output file will contain two tab-separated columns of ASCII text:  
   Attribute labels and the corresponding values.  Only the values from the
   currently-loaded tuning curve are saved.
 -- A .xls output file will contain multiple tab-separated columns of ASCII 
   text:  One columnn of attribute labels and N columns of corresponding 
   values, with N defined as above for .mat output.  Note:  '.xls' is the
   default filetype extension for Excel for Windows.  Excel and most other 
   spreadsheet programs will automatically recognize and import formatted
   text from such files.
  
  The .mat output format is best if all subsequent analyses and statistical 
  comparisons will be done using MatLab.  Text output formats allow the use 
  of other programs (e.g. the UNIXstat package, StatGraphics, Excel, etc) for
  subsequent analyses.
 
 input file formats:
 -------------------
   dtc format --
     binary format produced by you-know-what

                    indicates time slice (msec), 0 entries indicate no spikes
                    for that stimulus, non-zero entries indicate spike(s) 
                    occurred during that time slice for that stimulus.  one row
                    per stimulus amplitude, one column per stimulus frequency.

Window-specific information:
----------------------------
 
Tuning Curve Window:  
 
Display Menu:
  Lines: quiver plot (our standard tuning curve plot); axes are stimulus frequency
  and intensity, line length corresponds to number of spikes observed for a given
  frequency/intensity combination in the indicated time window.  Scale to right
  indicates number of spikes corresponding to minimum (0) and maximum line
  lengths.
  
  PColor: same things as 'Lines', but using color rather than line length to
  indicate number of spikes in window.  Colorbar at right indicates number of
  spikes corresponding to each color.
  
  Contour: same information as 'PColor', but equi-response contours are
  indicated.
 
  Surface: oblique view of 3-D PColor plot.  Color and altitude indicate number
  of spikes in time window.
  
  RasterByFreq: raster plot, one dot per spike: ordinate is time, abscissa is
  stimulus, where major divisions of abscissa are frequency bins, and each
  major division is subdivided by intensity (low at left to high at right). 
  *Using 'Mark' with this display sets the time slice.
 
  RasterByInt: raster plot, one dot per spike: abscissa is time, ordinate is
  stimulus, where major divisions of ordinate are intensity bins, and each
  major division is subdivided by frequency (low at bottom to high at top). 
  *Using 'Mark' with this display sets the time slice.
 
  TwoLines: copies currently displayed tuning curve to use a reference for
  future files.  The 'apply preferences on file load' preference should be set
  to 'no' to use this option.
 
Smoothing Menu:
  NoSmooth: Displayed data is the raw value.
  Smooth1: Displayed data is a weighted average of the raw value and its 8
  nearest neighbors.
  Smooth2: Displayed data is a weighted average (different weighting) of the raw
  value and its eight nearest neighbors *only if* there are three or more
  neighbors.  If there are two neighbors, displayed data is the raw value.  If
  there are no or one neighbor, zero is displayed.
  MedianSmooth: Displayed data is the median of the raw value and 8 nearest
  neighbors.
  
Preferences Menu:
  Load: load a previously saved preference file.
  Save: save current preferences to a file
  Modify: change current preference settings
  Apply: (re)apply current preference settings
  
Data: set directory and file name of input (data) file.  'Next' button assumes
the last five characters in the file name (before the extension) are numeric,
increments the number, and loads the new file.
 
Attributes: 'Show new' shows values of current measurements (those made since
last file was loaded).  'Append' appends these new measurements to the
measurement matrix.  'Show files' shows the numeric part of the filenames of
files analyzed so far (this is also known as the 'Spence-button').
 
Output File: set directory and file name of output (measurements) file.  'Save
to file' button saves current measurement matrix to the indicated file.  If the
file already exists, the current measurement matrix is appended to the one
already in the file.
 
Measure: 'CF' and 'Qxx' provide tools for measuring CF & threshold, and Q &
bandedges 10-40 dB from threshold.  'All' leads you through all of these
measurements sequentially.  'Lat', 'Histo', and 'Rate' open new windows to
measure latency, poststimulus time histogram, and rate parameters of
responses.  'Point' provides a tool for measuring an arbitrary point on the
axes in this figure.
 
Time Slice: allows you to set the time window used for display (and consequent
measurement) of these parameters.  Time slice can also be set by using the
'Mark' button when either RasterByFreq or RasterByInt plots are displayed. 
'rev', 'fwd', and 'half' buttons regress or advance the time slice by a full or
half 'duration' setting.
 
Film/Play: makes a movie of successive time slices.  you must 'Film' before you
can 'Play'.  successive time slices are incremented by half of the 'duration'
setting. 
 
Display: 'Blind' turns off axes tick marks.  'Spont' counts the number of spikes
in the lowest intensity row and removes a percentage of that number from each
row.  'Float/Fixed' sets the number of spikes corresponding to a full-length
line in the 'Lines' display; float sets the maximum number of spikes to the
longest line, fixed sets the indicated number of spikes to the longest line.
 
Range: 'Mark/Zoom' sets the function of click-dragging the left mouse button
over the axes; 'zoom' will zoom into the dragged rectangle, 'mark' marks the
dragged rectangle for use in the histogram, latency, and rate windows, or for
zapping.
 
Zap Points: remove all spikes in the selected frequency/intensity bin from the
dataset.  Zap Range removes all spikes in the selected frequency/intensity range
from the dataset.
 
The following are read from the file header, but can be set manually:
 
External Attenuation (contralateral and ipsilateral), recording Depth, Unit
number.  Note: if the unit number is followed by a letter, the letter is
recorded as a fractional addition to the unit number, where 0.01 corresponds to
'A' and 0.26 to 'Z'.
 
 
Latency Window:
  (Note: CF or range must be marked before this window will operate properly.)
  Each mark indicates one spike; 'x' indicates spikes at CF, '+' indicates
  (possibly) non-CF frequencies.  For 'CF' display, red indicates frequency
  one bin above CF, green indicates one frequency below CF.
  CF/Range:
  Zoom:
  Accept:
  
Histogram Window: 
  (Note: CF or range must be marked before this window will operate properly.) 
  Axes display poststimulus time histogram (PSTH) summed over all (All) or
  marked (Marked) stimuli.  Shaded range indicates one standard deviation. 
  Horizontal line indicates mean response.
  All/Marked: darker PSTH is of all stimuli or marked stimulus range.
  Mark buttons (Peak1stPk, End1stPk, Strt2ndPk, End2ndPk): lit button indicates
  how left mouse click on axes will be recorded: as peak or 
  end of the first peak (start should be = latency),  or as start or end of the
  (possibly nonexistent) second peak in the PSTH.
  Zoom: if this button is lit, click & drag with left button to zoom in. 
  (middle and right buttons also do stuff... the standard matlab zoom command). 
  Accept: accept current PSTH measurements.
 
Rate Window:
  (Note: CF or range must be marked before this window will operate properly.)
  Marker size corresponds to number of frequency bins with that number of
  spikes.  Circles are (possibly) non-CF frequencies, 'x' indicates value for
  CF.
  CF/Marked: displayed values are for CF +/- on frequency bin, or marked
  stimulus frequency range.
  Mark buttons (Threshold, Trans Pt, Endpoint, Best Ampl): left mouse click will
  be recorded as threshold, transition point, endpoint, or best amplitude.
  Accept: accept current rate measurements.
