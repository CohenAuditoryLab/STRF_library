4/98
changed computation of rateslope1 and rateslope2 to actually mean something.

8/98
added mean spontaneous rate and standard deviation to attributes, 
taking over places formerly occupied by unused entries 4 and 5.
modified decoding of dtc file header somewhat

9/98
added guess for latency based on Poisson process model for spike trains
changed erasemode to normal because win95 can't handle 'xor' properly
added font size menu for win95 and mac (note that font size on buttons does
  not resize on windows anyway, because windows is braindead)
split modprefs into pieces so win95 and mac can display them
